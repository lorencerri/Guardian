## Setup

Once Guardian is invited to your server, it is automatically setup with most of the latest features. Although there are a few things you may need to setup:

**Remember, you can view action limits by typing `g!limits`**

**Pinging Auto-Mute**
> By default, if a user makes 5 pings in a minute it will automatically mute them. Although, this **requires a role titled `Muted`**, and optionally, you can log all of the mutes if you **create a channel titled `Mutes`**.
